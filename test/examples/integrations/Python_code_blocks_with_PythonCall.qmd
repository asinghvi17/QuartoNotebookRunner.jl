This is a python code block but PyCall has not been made available in the session, yet, so it will fail.

```{python}
x = 1
```

Here we make PythonCall available, `import PythonCall` would also work

```{julia}
using PythonCall

x = 123
```

This is python code accessing a variable from Julia

```{python}
a = 5 * 1
a
```

Here we have a plot in python with a more complex interpolation
